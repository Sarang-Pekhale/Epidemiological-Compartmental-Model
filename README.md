# SEIQR Model Research Report

This repository contains a detailed research report on the SEIQR (Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Quarantined-Recovered) model, an epidemiological model used to simulate infectious disease dynamics that do not confer permanent immunity.

## Report Overview

The report provides a comprehensive analysis and documentation of the SEIQR model, including:

- **Model Derivation:** Detailed equations and descriptions of the SEIQR model compartments.
- **Mathematical Hypothesis:** Assumptions and constraints applied in the model.
- **Literature Review:** An overview of related research and existing models.
- **Simulation Results:** Insights from simulations, phase space analyses, and parameter sensitivity assessments.
- **Conclusions and Recommendations:** Concluding remarks and future directions.
